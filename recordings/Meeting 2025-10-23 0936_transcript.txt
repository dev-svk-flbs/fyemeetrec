[09:36:55] Okay, so now
[09:36:57] Now we have implemented the
[09:37:01] transcription. So now,
[09:37:03] transcription is happening at the same time.
[09:37:06] It is also sending the
[09:37:09] transcript to the server hopefully
[09:37:12] and hopefully it will catch up and eventually...
[09:37:16] we should not be able to
[09:37:18] Wait, in fact for
[09:37:21] you know, fear comparison because
[09:37:24] That's what I've been dealing with.
[09:37:24] Let me do...
[09:37:28] with the daily show and then I'm going to play
[09:37:30] I'm going to play...
[09:37:34] Um...
[09:37:36] this part.
[09:37:47] Just a moment.
[09:37:55] and it.
[09:37:55] Oh.
[09:37:55] That's perfect.
[09:37:55] Okay.
[09:37:55] Alright.
[09:37:55] That's perfect.
[09:37:55] So let's start with the last one.
[09:37:55] Okay.
[09:37:55] All right.
[09:37:55] Yeah, let's do it.
[09:37:55] Okay.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] So let's do the last one.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] So let's finish this.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] So let's do a little bit.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:56] Good.
[09:37:56] Let's do the second one.
[09:37:56] Yeah.
[09:37:56] Okay.
[09:37:57] Okay, that's not ideal.
[09:37:58] On one hand, you don't want air traffic controllers staying up all night.
[09:37:59] working a second job, but on the other hand, the sky.
[09:38:00] is like really big you know
[09:38:01] The planes probably won't bump into each other.
[09:38:03] other? What's the worst it could happen?
[09:38:06] The law's claim crashes into our unguarded nuclear weapon.
[09:38:09] and it's not that bad.
[09:38:12] Look, I...
[09:38:16] I hate that this is happening.
[09:38:16] I don't wanna get into an Uber.
[09:38:18] and feel bad when my driver tells me he's an out of work.
[09:38:21] traffic controller. I want to get in an Uber and feel bad with it.
[09:38:24] My driver tells me he was an oncologist in Armenia.
[09:38:31] But if single this
[09:38:32] hardworking people getting screwed over is hurting you a little feeling.
[09:38:33] don't worry there is one federal employee.
[09:38:36] who do be getting that Monet.
[09:38:39] This morning, sources tell ABC News that President Trump
[09:38:42] is pushing for a personal 230 million
[09:38:45] dollar payout from the Justice Department as compensation.
[09:38:48] for the federal investigations he's faced.
[09:38:49] He is demanding.
[09:38:51] $230 million because he faced special counsel in business.
[09:38:54] of his campaign's contacts with Russia and is removed.
[09:38:58] Move of classified documents from the White House, to his home in Mar-a-Wago.
[09:39:00] $230 million.
[09:39:03] Look, I know it's not exactly what black people want.
[09:39:06] but the American government is finally paying reparations.
[09:39:10] And, what it is
[09:39:12] to an old white billionaire president but that's why you need to be more
[09:39:15] specific when you're manifesting.
